<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Setu Kaswan, a passionate and driven Bachelor of Technology student in Computer Science at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, Delhi. With hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development, I have successfully built and deployed several projects including an e-commerce website and a real-time chat application. My technical skills include proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Flutter. I am also adept at leveraging Python for machine learning projects, having developed models to predict house prices using various algorithms. My strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), combined with practical problem-solving abilities, is demonstrated by my 4-star rating on CodeChef and consistent performance on LeetCode. I am eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to your team as a Full Stack Developer Intern, where I can further develop my abilities and contribute to innovative projects.</p>
